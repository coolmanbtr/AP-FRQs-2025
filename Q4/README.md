# Question 4 Reflection  

## SumOrSameGame  

This section presents my analysis of Question 4, which focused on 2D arrays.  

### My Initial Approach During the Exam:

- Used a nested for loop to iterate through the rows and columns.  
- Applied Math.random to generate values between 1 and 9.  

### My Revised Solution After Review: 

- Created a new puzzle and assigned values using puzzle = (int) (Math.random() * 9) + 1.  

### Key Concepts Tested in This Question:
  
- Using Math.random for random number generation.  
- Implementing a for loop to traverse rows.  
- Using another for loop to iterate through columns.  

### What I Learned from Revisiting This Problem:
  
- How to correctly generate random numbers within a specific range.  
- Efficiently working with nested loops to handle 2D arrays.
