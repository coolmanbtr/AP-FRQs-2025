# Question 1 Reflection

## Dog Walker

This section provides my insights on Question 1, which focused on methods and control structures.

#### My Initial Approach During the Exam:

- I recognized the need for an if statement in my code.
- I also needed a variable to determine the number of available dogs from the company.
- For part B, a for loop was essential to iterate through the hours.
- Additionally, I included a variable to keep track of total earnings.

#### My Revised Solution After Review:

- I realized that when calling methods such as .numAvailableDogs and .updateDogs, I needed to reference the company object correctly.

#### Key Concepts Tested in This Question:

- Using method calls effectively.
- Implementing for loops.
- Applying if statements for logic control.
- Managing variables to store important values.

#### What I Learned from Revisiting This Problem:

- I discovered that I could simplify my logic by using a single if statement with the || (or) operator, making the code more efficient and easier to read.
