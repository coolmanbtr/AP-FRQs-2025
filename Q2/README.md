## Question 2 Reflection  

## Signature  

This section presents my analysis of Question 2, which focused on class design.  

### My Initial Approach During the Exam:
- Defined the class name, instance variables, and constructor.  
- Implemented the "getSignature" method to format the signature.  
- Developed the "addSignature" method to modify the text as required.  

### My Revised Solution After Review: 
- Utilized indexOf and substring to efficiently handle signature placement in the addSignature method.  

### **Key Concepts Tested in This Question:**  

- Designing and structuring a class correctly.  
- Using indexOf to locate specific text positions.  
- Applying substring to manipulate string content.  

### What I Learned from Revisiting This Problem: 

- Ensured proper handling of cases where names were empty.  
- Improved efficiency when working with text and string operations.
