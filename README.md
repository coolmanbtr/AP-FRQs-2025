# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions by Amirjon G*

## Introduction 
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on May 7th, 2025. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

#### Exam Experience 
I reflect on my experience taking the AP Computer Science exam, highlighting key moments, challenges, and lessons learned.

- My exam preparation strategy included completing all assignments posted by Mr. Hans, as well as any additional practice materials, such as textbook exercises for multiple-choice questions.
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were the free-response questions (FRQs) that involved the class and Arrays.
- I spent 15 minutes on each FRQ question, so I could evenlly spread out my time. This helped me to do all questions and allowed me to got back and finish up anything with my spare time.

#### Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Arrays: Fixed-size lists that store multiple values of the same type. You access elements using an index, and loops help modify or traverse them efficiently.
- ArrayLists: Resizable lists that allow dynamic storage. They have built-in methods for adding, removing, and searching elements without manually handling resizing.
- Practice using arrays and ArrayLists by writing programs that store and modify data. Try sorting and searching elements to strengthen your skills.

#### Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- AP College Board:https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/
- Knowt: https://knowt.com/exams/AP/AP-Computer-Science-A

#### Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
-Try and learn a new language or improve on Python.
-Get interships to increase my experience and skills in programming
