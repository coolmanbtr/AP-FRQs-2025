# Question 3 Reflection  

## Competition/Competitor  

This section provides my analysis of Question 3, which focused on Arrays and ArrayLists.  

### My Initial Approach During the Exam: 

- I knew I had to create a new ArrayList.  
- I needed a for loop to iterate through and add names to the list.  

### My Revised Solution After Review:

- I realized I should use competitorList.add to correctly insert names into the list.  

### Key Concepts Tested in This Question:

- Initializing a new ArrayList.  
- Using a for loop to process multiple entries.  
- Applying the .add method within the loop to populate the list.  

### What I Learned from Revisiting This Problem:

- Properly defining an ArrayList using new ArrayList<>(); .  
- Using .add efficiently to store elements within the list.
